### Data
The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/, an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The download instructions are provided in the next segment. The data for GDP analysis of the Indian states is divided into two parts:

Data I-A: This dataset consists of the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.

Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states. You are expected to read the dataset for the available states and join these (in Python) if needed.


There are two parts to this project. In the first part, you will analyse and compare the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). The GDP of a state is referred to as the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Then, you will divide the states into four categories based on the GDP per capita, and for each of these four categories, you will analyse the sectors that contribute the most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.).


In the second part, you will analyse whether GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges.
